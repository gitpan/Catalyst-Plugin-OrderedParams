NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::OrderedParams - Maintain order of submitted form
    parameters

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst 'OrderedParams';

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin enables handling of GET and POST parameters in an ordered
    fashion. By default in Catalyst, form parameters are stored in a simple
    hash, which loses the original order in which the paramters were
    submitted. This plugin stores parameters in a Tie::IxHash which will
    retain the original submitted order.

    One particular application for this plugin is email handlers, where you
    want the output of your email to reflect the order of form elements in
    the form.

    Simply add this plugin to your application and the following code will
    be in the proper order.

        for my $param ( $c->req->param ) {
            $email .= $param . ": " . $c->req->param( $param );
        }

  METHODS
    prepare_request (extended)
        Replace the parameters hash in Catalyst::Request with a tied hash.
